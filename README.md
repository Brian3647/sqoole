## **What is sqoole?**

Sqoole is a minimalist, open-source messaging app where chats get automatically deleted after less than 7 days. This is specially useful for small conversations that are not meant to be there forever, giving full security and trust to the users.

## **Contributing**

Check [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for all the information on how to help the project.

## **Project Status**

The API is mostly finished (even though email verification should be worked on asap), so the main focus now is the front-end.
