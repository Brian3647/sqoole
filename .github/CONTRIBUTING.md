# **Contributing :beers:**

This project is made using Bun (the javascript runtime & toolkit) along with TypeScript and supabase.

You will need to have both installed and a supabase project created, which you will need to get the database password from and create a file named `.env` with the following contents:

```env
DB_PASSWORD=<supabase project database password>
```

## **The front-end (pain)**

It uses Nuxt. Sadly. Please work on it. I don't like building front-end.

## **Commit format**

It's required to use [gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli) for your commits.
